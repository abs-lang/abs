# A few technical details...

The ABS interpreter is built with Golang version `1.11`, and is mostly based on [the interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/) written by [Thorsten Ball](https://twitter.com/thorstenball).

ABS is extremely different from Monkey, the "fictional" language the reader builds throughout the book, but the base structure (lexer, parser, evaluator) are still very much based on Thorsten's work.

## Why Go?

There are multiple reasons Go is the ideal choice for ABS, in no
particular order:

* portability, as our goal is to be able to deliver ABS to
multiple platforms without any hassle
* performance, as ABS' itself is not big on performance: having the
interpreter based on a fast platform allows us to recover
something back
* "strict" language, suitable for the purpose of making sure
syntax / parser errors are easily caught
* rich standard library, which allows to ship most of the ABS'
interpreter without relying on many external dependencies

## Development & contributing

The best way to start developing *for* ABS is to clone the repository
and run a `make build`: this will build a docker container with all
the necessary dependencies for developing locally (for experienced
Gophers: you might want to skip this altogether as your environment
will probably work perfectly).

With `make run` you can get inside a container built for ABS'
development, and `make test` will run all tests.

## Roadmap

We're currently working on the [preview-4](https://github.com/abs-lang/abs/milestone/7).

That's about it for this section!
