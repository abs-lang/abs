# The ABS programming language

ABS is a scripting language that works best when you're on
your terminal. It tries to combine the elegance of languages
such as Python, or Ruby, to the convenience of Bash.

``` bash
tz = $(cat /etc/timezone);
continent, city = tz.split("/")

echo("Best city in the world?")

selection = stdin()

if selection == city {
  echo("You might be biased...")
}
```

Let's try to fetch our IP address and print the sum of its
parts, if its higher than 100. Here's how you could do it
in Bash:

``` bash
# Simple program that fetches your IP and sums it up
RES=$(curl -s 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json' || "ERR")

if [ "$RES" = "ERR" ]; then
    echo "An error occurred"
    exit 1
fi

IP=$(echo $RES | jq -r ".ip")
IFS=. read first second third fourth <<EOF
${IP##*-}
EOF

total=$((first + second + third + fourth))
if [ $total -gt 100 ]; then
    echo "The sum of [$IP] is a large number, $total."
fi
```

And here's how you could write the same code in ABS:

``` bash
# Simple program that fetches your IP and sums it up
res = $(curl -s 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json');

if !res.ok {
  echo("An error occurred: %s", res)
  exit(1)
}

ip = res.json().ip
total = ip.split(".").map(int).sum()
if total > 100 {
    echo("The sum of [%s] is a large number, %s.", ip, total)
}
```
